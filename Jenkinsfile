Usage and Modification
Mocking Behavior: The above Jenkinsfile is structured to provide output similar to what you have shown in the screenshot. It doesn't execute real commands but rather describes what each step would typically do.
Adding Actual Commands: To make this Jenkinsfile operational, replace the echo statements with actual shell commands (sh), as commented.
Debugging and Documentation: This structure is particularly useful for debugging Jenkins pipelines or when documenting pipeline steps without executing any operations

can you do the code like this without using maven
ChatGPT
Certainly! Based on the visual style and structure of your Jenkinsfile as described, here's a simplified Jenkinsfile with just echo statements for each stage, avoiding the use of Maven or any specific tool commands. This approach is useful for structuring or mocking up your pipeline before implementing the actual logic.
